1. Data selection:
    - 1.2 Selected datasets:
        Anirudh and Zhenwei
        - final_dataset.csv 
        - goodreads_books.csv (requires link and description)

        Sam, Yong and Fatemeh 
        - books_10k  (requires link and description)
        make a rating point distribution and make comparison with average rating
        - book_data.csv  (requires link and description)
        
       
2. Datasets preprocessing
    - 2.1 Importing, changing column names to more readable names, omitting unwanted columns.
    - 2.2 Omitting or substituting null values in the datasets
    
   
3. Doing some querries on the indivial datasets (because the merged ones would have much lower number of rows) (*data analysis*)  
     
4. Datasets aggregation
    - 4.1 merging the datasets together for deriving more information
    - 4.2 Doing queries on the aggregated data (*data analysis*)
        - 4.2.1 Exploring  the current Juperter notebooks in Kaggle and searching for interesting queries and analysis they have done. List them in the following:
            - for **book_data.csv**
            - Creating a bag of words from "genres" | "best authors like those who has sold the most" [a sample can be found here]: (https://www.kaggle.com/pierpaolo28/machine-learning-visualization-4) or here (https://medium.com/better-programming/create-custom-word-clouds-in-python-841563933e73)
            - Is there any relationship with genres and the book_format? What percentage of Hardcover books are horror genre
            - Is there any relationship between number of pages and the rating? Are the books with pages more than n, more disliked in a specific genre?
            - Can we identify a book\'92s genre from its description? (Converting description to a bag of words)
            - Are the books with more than one author more disliked?
            - What are the most repeated words in a specific genre\'92s title? Like \'93kill\'94 in horror
            - Distribution of ratings
            - Using the "authors" dataset, finding the birth place of authors (both generally and based on the genre)

            - for **book_10k.csv**
            - Because we have the year of publication (might not be initial one) what is the genre trend in this dataset? (By merging with above dataset)
            - What is the genre trend for a specific author?
            - Rating distribution (A better one since we have all rating accounts (from 1 to 5)
            - Are people leaning towards writing reviews for a specific genre? Or is the number of reviews correlated with the rating a book gets?
     
     
**Phase 2 (Book recommendation)** (Feb 14- Feb 20) 

5. Finding a dataset which contain the pair (user, book) to know what books have been read and liked by a single user
6. Creating a recommender system\

[One relevant notebook] (https://www.kaggle.com/aayushmishra1512/what-should-you-read-next-book-recommender)
[Another relevant notebook] (https://www.kaggle.com/snanilim/book-recommendation-engine)



Further improvement (Feb 21 - Feb 27)\

**Phase 3 (Creating an interactive app/surface/website)** 

7. Create a well-written description about the project and add the interactive parts, plots, etc to the desired platform. Website, etc



**Phase 4 (Finalization and preparation for presentation)** (Feb 28- March 6)

8. Observing the code and the whole project for potential fault detection and improvements (Feb 28-Feb 29)
9. Creating slides for presentation \
10. Recording a presentation (should be sumbitted at least one week before the deadline for getting feedbacks from Professor and TAs.)
